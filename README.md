Shob is a desktop app for running and organizing multiple CLI agents in one workspace.
It helps you keep parallel sessions focused, persistent, and easy to switch between.

## Why Shob

- Run multiple CLI sessions side by side.
- Keep session context inside the same project.
- Switch quickly between tasks without losing flow.
- Use a desktop-first experience powered by Electron.
